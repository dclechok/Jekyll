So here we are...  Today is the start of a new journey for me, and I'm very excited! I've decided that it is the right time to take this leap.  

I've always had an interest in programming, and I've dabbled for many years, but only on the surface.  I remember spending many hours as a kid writing HTML in notepad working on designing a fresh new website.  I took C++ in school, but never really understood the depth of the language.  Then I went to college for software development -- working with languages such as HTML/CSS, VB, C/C++, and Java.  Unfortunately, do to some family issues, I didn't end up completing the degree.  In my spare time though, I practiced C# in game development and various game engines.  I'm looking forward to becoming a professional developer!

I enjoyed working through the bootcamp here.  I had some issues working with hashes and enumerables, but I think with more practice it will be easier for me.

Do you ever spend hours upon hours working on code, and all the sudden you look at the screen and it all just looks like meaningless and non-sensical?  I'm learning when I need to step away for a moment.

I hope when I look back at this blog post in 5 months I will have the skills and confidence of a professional developer, and I can chuckle at how much trouble I've been having getting used to hashes and enumerables!  üòÅ

So here we are...  Day one.  September 9th.  On to the first lesson...
